=================================
UnrealScript IDE has been updated
=================================

New Stuff:
----------

* **Performance increase**
	* This comes with a downside of performance decrease at the very first startup, but after that it will be much faster
	* I'm saving a list of all classes to a cache file at startup, so that I can later load the classes from it.
	  
	  PLEASE NOTE: If you create new class files, modify the file name of your class or modify what your class extends
		you'll have to delete the cache file to rebuild the class list (and restart Sublime). The cache file is in your Src directory and is named: classes_cache.obj

* **Classes auto-completion**
	* classes do now also appear in the completions list.
	* especially helpful in the class declaration line when you are thinking about what class to extend.

* **Object-oriented go to declaration support**
	* e.g. activating goto declaration over controller.GetPlayerViewPoint(a, b) will take you to the declaration of GetPlayerViewPoint in Controller
	* typecasting is not yet supported.

Object-oriented Auto-completion is coming soon!!!
