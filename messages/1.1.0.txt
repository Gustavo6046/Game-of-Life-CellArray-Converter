=================================
UnrealScript IDE has been updated
=================================

New Stuff:
----------

* **Fully Object Oriented Auto-Completion**
	* expressions such as WorldInfo.Game.* will now list you all available completions of the object Game (e.g. Broadcast)
	* this does also work with function with a return value, e.g:
		Trace(HitLocation, HitNormal, traceEnd).* would give you suggestions from the Actor class, because trace returns Actor
	* typecasting is also supported: Pawn(other).* would display completions from the Pawn class.

* **Fully Object Oriented Go to Declaration**
	* Go to Declaration now also works on all expressions where auto-completion works, e.g. using Go to Declaration here:
		WorldInfo.Game.Broadc|ast(self, "hello!") would take you to the line where Broadcast was declared

* **Automatic rebuilding of the cache file**
	* The cache file will now be rebuild automatically when necessary.
	* The only situation where you have to rebuild the cache file manually is if you delete a class.
		To do so go to 'Tools' -> 'UnrealScriptIDE: Rebuild Cache' or use Ctrl+Shift+P and search for it.
	* If you modify a class in another application you need to save this file at least once in Sublime to register your changes.

Plans and thoughts about future versions:
-----------------------------------------

* **Add support for Structs (high priority)**
	* currently structs aren't supported. e.g. if you type Actor(other).Location.* you won't get x, y, z although you would want to.
	* same for Enumerations

* **Support for local variables**
	* local variables and function arguments should also appear in the completion list

* **live parsing of the current file**
	* if you have declared a variable such as: var Pawn MyPawn; and immediately afterwards type MyPawn.* it won't give you any suggestions.
		To get your suggestions you have to save your file first.
