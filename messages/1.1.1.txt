=================================
UnrealScript IDE has been updated
=================================

New Stuff:
----------

* **Support for inbuild functions and variables has been added (arrays and class)**
	* read the note below

NOTE
----

	I usually wouldn't bother you with such a small update, but to enable the support for inbuild functions you have to rebuild your cache file:
	This can be done using 'Tools' -> 'UnrealScript IDE: Rebuild Cache' or ctrl + shift + p -> search for 'rebuild cache' -> hit enter.
	This may take a while, but it's a one time operation.
