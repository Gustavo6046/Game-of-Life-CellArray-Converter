=================================
UnrealScript IDE has been updated
=================================

New Stuff:
----------
* **Read the NOTE below**

* **UnrealDebugger integration**
	* UnrealDebugger will now be automatically installed when you build your game in debug mode.
	To do so, press ctrl+alt+b or alt+f7. If you had another debugger (such as NFringe) installed before, it will preserve the shared dll.
	You can uninstall UnrealDebugger through the command palette (ctrl+shift+p) by searching for "UnrealScriptIDE: Uninstall UnrealDebugger". This will restore the dll of your old debugger.
	* To use it, start your game with a debug configuration
	* You can set breakpoints directly inside Sublime Text 2 by either using the right click menu or with the shortcut ctrl+. to toggle a breakpoint or ctrl+shift+. to deactivate a breakpoint.

* **Optimazations to the parser**
	* You probably don't even notice anything, however you still need to rebuild your cache, otherwise nothing will work anymore.

NOTE
----

	Again, this update requires you to rebuild your cache file:
	This can be done using 'Tools' -> 'UnrealScript IDE: Rebuild Cache' or ctrl + shift + p -> search for 'rebuild cache' -> hit enter.
