=================================
UnrealScript IDE has been updated
=================================

New Stuff:
----------
* **Read the NOTE below - rebuild cache!**

* **UnrealDebugger Improvements**
	*	UnrealDebugger got a small update, allowing you to deactivate the first "invisible" breakpoint.
		This will be used as the default setting from now on.
		You can change that in the settings if you like.

* **More Settings exposed**
	*	You can now add additional map extensions
	*	You can now specify your own keywords to use for auto-completion

* **Added live build output**
	*	Its a little bit buggy, but it works.

* **some bug fixing (one of them requires you to rebuild the cache file)**
	* I tried to fix the "just a moment..." bug again, hope I was lucky this time ;-)

NOTE
----

	Again, this update requires you to rebuild your cache file:
	This can be done using 'Tools' -> 'UnrealScript IDE: Rebuild Cache' or ctrl + shift + p -> search for 'rebuild cache' -> hit enter.
